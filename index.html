                        <p>The pinnacle of my life's work is my <em>Live Retreat</em> program, the purpose of which is to take people through a fully immersive process to transform every aspect of not just their lifestyle, but their <span class="highlight"><strong>mindset, relationships, emotional well being</strong></span> and <span class="highlight"><strong>core confidence</strong></span> too.</p>
                        <p>There’s no denying that these unprecedented times have been something none of us could have ever planned for. It was the first time in over 10 years that we’ve had to postpone our <em>Live Retreat</em>, (and the <em>Retreats</em> mean the world to me and my team).</p>
                        <p>But instead of focusing on what we couldn’t do, we decided to figure out what we could do and adapt to the situation, even when the conditions weren’t perfect. And so, we created the <em>Matthew Hussey Virtual Retreat</em>.</p>
                        <p>This 3-day live stream event has been custom-designed by me and my incredible team to bring the same immersive magic of the <em>Live Retreat</em> straight to your computer in the comfort of your own home.</p>
                        <p>Being able to bring the <em>Virtual Retreat</em> to people all over the world during this time has been a truly special experience, and the feedback has been nothing short of incredible.</p>
                        <p>That's why we’re doing it AGAIN this <strong>September 24th - 26th</strong> and I want YOU to join me.</p>
                        <p>I’ve gone to great lengths to make this experience truly life-changing. During these 3 unique and powerful days, I’m going to hand you <span class="highlight"><strong>the same proven tools and life-changing processes</strong></span> from my <em>Live Retreat</em> that has transformed thousands of lives for over a decade, with <span class="highlight"><strong>content customized and contextualized for this unprecedented time,</strong></span> so you can transform your life, too.</p>
                        <p>I’ll take you through the life-changing process LIVE online, alongside my team and an incredible tribe who are on the same journey and are there to support you every step of the way.</p>

The <em>Virtual Retreat</em> is going to show you how to get back out there and design what you want to happen as a result of this chapter. We’ll be looking at the intention behind every aspect of your lifestyle. What goals you’re setting for yourself, what books you’re going to read, where you’re going to visit, what you’re going to create, what your spare time looks like, what you’re going to transform in terms of your own limiting beliefs, your own confidence, your own piece of mind. And more importantly, we’re going to be looking at WHY you want to make these new choices. Intention is so important and we’re going to spend those 3 days getting really clear about what we want to do in our lives over the next 12 months.</p>

You see, people think confidence is this mysterious thing. It’s not. There is a practical roadmap to building confidence that involves how we talk to ourselves, how we forgive ourselves and building a life that makes us proud. If you want to learn this roadmap with me over 3 days of coaching immersion to transform your confidence once and for all, then the <em>Virtual Retreat</em> is for you.</p>

So if you’re just looking for some external influence and guidance to help you level up and keep your momentum going, then you’re going to love this program.</p>

If you feel like no amount of dating advice has changed your love life, there may be deeper things holding it back. There are three things that create an incredible love life. The first is our confidence, the second is how we communicate our value to somebody else and the third is building a life that someone wants to be a part of. Any one of these 3 things not being where it should be has the potential to derail our entire love life. If you want to learn how to master all 3, then the <em>Virtual Retreat</em> is something that you must be a part of.</p>
